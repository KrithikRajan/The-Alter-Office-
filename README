# Elemental Weapon System with Visual Effects

## Overview
This Unity project demonstrates a modular weapon system that allows players to switch between three elemental weapons: Fire, Ice, and Electricity. Each weapon has unique visual effects created using Unityâ€™s Shader Graph and VFX Graph. The system is designed with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to ensure modularity and extensibility.

## Features
- **Modular Weapon System**: Switch between Fire, Ice, and Electricity weapons using a simple UI.
- **Unique Visual Effects**:
  - **Fire Weapon**: Fiery visual effect with a fireball projectile.
  - **Ice Weapon**: Frosty effect with an ice projectile.
  - **Electricity Weapon**: Electric field effect with a continuous lightning beam.
- **Shader Graph**: Custom shaders for each weapon effect.
- **VFX Graph**: Enhanced visual effects for each weapon.
- **Mobile Optimization**: Ensured smooth performance on Android devices.

## Design Approach

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts
The weapon system is designed using OOP principles to allow for easy extensibility and maintenance. Key concepts used include:
- **Inheritance**: Base `Weapon` class with derived classes for each weapon type (`FireWeapon`, `IceWeapon`, `ElectricityWeapon`).
- **Polymorphism**: Switching between different weapon types using a common interface.
- **Encapsulation**: Weapon properties and behaviors are encapsulated within their respective classes.

### Visual Effects
Each weapon has been given a unique look and feel using Shader Graph and VFX Graph.
- **Fire Weapon**: Uses a Shader Graph to create a fiery effect with animated flames. The fireball projectile has a trail of fire particles.
- **Ice Weapon**: Implements a frosty effect using Shader Graph with snowflake patterns. The ice projectile leaves a trail of ice shards.
- **Electricity Weapon**: Features an electric field effect with Shader Graph, with a continuous lightning beam created using VFX Graph.

### Mobile Performance Optimization
- **Shader Optimization**: Simplified shaders to reduce computational load.
- **VFX Graph Optimization**: Limited the number of particles and used mobile-friendly settings to ensure smooth performance.
- **Object Pooling**: Implemented for projectiles to minimize runtime instantiation overhead.
